## Image processing

This process requires lot of image variations, for any further processing. Taking that into consideration, using python we can automate the process of delivering various modes of images that best suits for any image processing step. Advantage of integrating this idea with python is that we can automate the process, for a bulk no.of images. On carrying out this process, Bulk variations of images can be generated.

Each edits will be stored in different folders, which becomes easier to access and organize. Process of converting images in bulk manner in one click improves the ultimate notion of the process. 

## Pillow Library

The Python Imaging Library adds image processing capabilities to your Python interpreter.

This library provides extensive file format support, an efficient internal representation, and fairly powerful image processing capabilities.

The core image library is designed for fast access to data stored in a few basic pixel formats. It should provide a solid foundation for a general image processing tool.
